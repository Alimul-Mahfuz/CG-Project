# CG-Project
Introduction:
This is a computer graphics project based on OpenGL and C++. The project has been developed a 2D model of the country highway scene. The project is developed with the focus on Highway scene Day, Night and Rainy Days. The project features a school, house, and river views along the highway. The project also has a sound system mode.
Background:
For making this project a success, other than the important topics that were discussed in the class, some additional resources were searched for widening our knowledge about 2D graphics. Looking at the documented and complete projects of various other 2D models, we could have an idea about how to start working on our project and what elements could be added to the environment.
Objective:
The objective of the project is to implement the knowledge that we have from the completion of the course of Computer Graphics. Through the project, the understanding level of OpenGL and the knowledge of programming concepts learned in class can be assumed. We used discussed topic like rotation, transformation, and translation in this project. We also added ambient sound like rain sound to make the scenery more alive. Besides, we also applied opengl function like keyboard and mouse interaction to our project.

Significant of the project:
This project represents the daily scenario of a village side highway. This project can be of great importance if it is used in the right place and in the right way. It can be used as a simulation for a highway planning. It can also be used to demonstrate the planning for rural area. Besides, this scenery can be used as template for animation and game making.

Conclusion:
The project was an essential part as an effort to learn about 2D graphics models in computer graphics with OpenGL. Using the concepts implemented in the project, and practicing more, we can participate in bigger and more complex assignments associated with models and graphics in the future. The number of features could not be increased due to time constraints but was completed fully in the provided time frame.
